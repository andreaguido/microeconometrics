# Microeconometrics
This is the repository for the Applied Information Analysis (Microeconometrics) course (Andrea Guido)

## Description

The aim of this subject is to provide students sufficient knowledge of the most updated topics in microeconometrics so that they can choose the most appropriate estimators. The program is designed to respond to the needs of researchers and practitioners when working with data, where an important dimension in the unit of analysis is the individual. This requires the use of micro data and the use of advanced techniques in (micro) econometrics. The practical content of this course has two objectives: on the one hand, the knowledge and management of the statistic-econometric software R, on the other hand, being able to solve practical cases that require the use of the various estimators explained in the theoretical part of the program.

## Syllabus

The syllabus cover three macro areas:

1. Linear models using cross-sectional data: Definition of Simple Linear Regression Model, OLS Parameter estimation, OLS from Algebra to Inference, Goodness of fit, Case-study: CEOs salary determinants, Theoretical Assumptions of linear models (Gauss-Markov), Properties of OLS estimator under Gauss-Markov assumptions, Asymptotic properties, Monte-Carlo Simulation to study OLS properties, Multiple regression, Multiple regression with qualitative independent variables, Interaction terms, Further issues when estimating OLS (Heteroskedasticity, Omitted variable bias)

2. Binary outcome models: Intro to binary variable models, Linear probability model, Limitations: towards a more accurate model specification, Logit and probit, PEA and AMA, Maximum likelihood estimation of logit and probit models, A comparison exercise of all models, Estimating the predicted probability from a model

3. Panel models: pooled cross section models, Policy Evaluation with Pooled cross sections, 2-period Panel Data, Policy Evaluation with 2-period Panel Data, Fixed effects estimator, Random Effects estimator
